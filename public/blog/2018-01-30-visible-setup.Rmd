```

After a long time coming, I've finally got round to picking a workable solution for creating my data blog "Visible Data". This is a short overview of how I picked my tools and my intentions for the website.

I had three core requirements:

- I could write the blog in RMarkdown
- I could easily include `htmlwidgets` in blogposts (and elsewhere)
- I could use Bootstrap grids wherever I fancied (I'm obsessed with responsive grids)

## RMarkdown

Previously I made use of Dean Attali's awesome [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme for creating a static website website hosted on GitHub Pages. I'd thoroughly recommend this for creating a very quick website where you **don't** need RMarkdown because GitHub's Jekyll builder doesn't support it at all. 

There are a few websites I contribute to that still use Beautiful Jekyll, including the excellent [Reproducible Research Oxford Project](rroxford.github.io) which runs [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) training courses to encourage reproducible research methodologies.

The simplest solution for creating a blog which allows us to write content in RMarkdown is the excellent `blogdown` package, which is thoroughly introduced in Yihui Xie et al's freely available book [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

## htmlwidgets

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6">

If you've never heard of them, `htmlwidgets` are an amazing part of the work that RStudio have undertaken to make R a beautiful tool for doing data science and communicating things about your data.

`htmlwidgets` is a tool for R developers that allows them to easily build R wrappers for JavaScript libraries, which means useRs can build interactive visualisations like the interactive choropleth embedded here using `leaflet`.

Fantastically, `htmlwidgets` are supported natively by `blogdown`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("leaflet")
library("sf")
library("gapminder")

geojson_worldmap <- st_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johan/world.geo.json/master/countries.geo.json",
                            quiet = TRUE)
geojson_worldmap <- invisible(geojson_worldmap %>%
  left_join(gapminder %>%
               filter(year == max(year)) , by = c("name" = "country")) %>%
  filter(name != "Antarctica"))
palette_pop <- colorNumeric("YlOrBr" , geojson_worldmap$pop, na.color = "#c0c1c4")
geojson_worldmap %>%
  leaflet(width = "350px",
          height = "200px") %>%
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~palette_pop(pop),
              fillOpacity = 0.8,
              color = "#000",
              weight = 1,
              label = ~name,
              popup = ~paste(name, "had a population of", formatC(pop, big.mark = ","), "in", max(gapminder$year), "<br>", "According to <a href='http://Gapminder.org' target='_blank'>Gapminder.org</a>"))
```

However, there's not actually that much love for `htmlwidgets` or promotion of them!. If you search through <a href='https://www.twitter.com/hadleywickham'>@hadleywickham</a>'s tweets from January 2018 to the dawn of Twitter, `htmlwidgets` were only mentioned **three** times! I've blogged about [where's the love for htmlwidgets](http://www.visibledata.co.uk/blog/2018/01/30/2018-01-30-where-s-the-love-for-htmlwidgets/) and produced a **5h+ training course** on [building interactive dataviz with htlmlwidgets for Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/R-Interactive-Visualizations-htmlwidgets/586671-2.html)

## Bootstrap grids

Boostrap is a framework for building responsive websites - these are websites that *reflow* content as the browser window changes. Bootstrap is very popular and used all over the web, it's also [how `shiny` apps are laid out](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html).

The Hugo theme I used for this `blogdown` website uses Bootstrap which means (for instance) the navigation menu gets collapsed in narrow browser windows. But I can also use elements of Bootstrap wherever I want in blogposts/pages of the site by writing `HTML` in my `.Rmd` files, for instance in the section about htmlwidgets above you'd have seen the choropleth either to the right or below of the first three paragraphs. One of the biggest concerns I have about this data blog is I'll spemnd  

which means as you change the size of your browser window (or device you're viewing this website on) content *reflows* and attempts to fit things 

## Replicate this site {.replicate-this-blog}

This website uses the wonderful [Hugo Universal Theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme) and was built using the following steps (a slightly tailored version of the workflow in Yihui's book, [**do read the book**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/))

1. Create a new RStudio Project (if you're not using RStudio projects, [you really should be](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Why-should-you-use-projects-RStudio/586672/648981-4.html))
1. Initialise a git repo with `usethis::usethis::use_git()`
1. Run `blogdown::new_site(theme = 'devcows/hugo-universal-theme')`
1. In the `config.toml` file make the following changes:
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b
