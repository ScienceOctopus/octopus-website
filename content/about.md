# Octopus

What would science look like if we started again? The idea of Octopus is to create a one-stop place for all scientific researchâ€¦ freely open to all and language agnostic. Octopus is designed to be a community-owned platform, using existing open publishing tools and encouraging others to develop more to make it serve the needs of science.

# How it works
