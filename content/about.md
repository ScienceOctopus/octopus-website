# Octopus
What would science look like if we started again? Octopus is a community-owned platform for all scientific research. It a new way of giving access to scientific discoveries and working collaboratively on projects. Octopus uses a variety of existing publishing tools and encourages others to develop more to make it serve the needs of science.

# How is works

Octopus is designed to make science more meritocratic, efficient, collaborative and reward replicable and replication work.

The categories of publication Users can publish in the following categories:

1) A problem/research question
2) A hypothesis/theory
3) A protocol or method (experimental and statistical)
4) Data (a data overview linked to a data repository for the raw data)
5) A statistical analysis of data
6) An interpretation
7) A real-world application
As well as 8) A review

The first 7 form a natural chain, and it will only be possible to publish each if it is linked to the level above.
