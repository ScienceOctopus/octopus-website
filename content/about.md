# Octopus

What would science look like if we started again? The idea of Octopus is to create a one-stop place for all scientific researchâ€¦ freely open to all and language agnostic. Octopus is designed to be a community-owned platform, pulling together existing open publishing tools and encouraging others to develop more to make it serve the needs of science. Break the bonds that bind science to journals and which encourage poor scientific practice.

# How it will work

### Read
Easily find what's being published in any scientific field, accessible to all, regardless of language and with no paywalls because it will all be in the same place and digital-first.

### Write
Log in and publish your own ideas, data, analysis or real-world applications. No need to create an entire 'paper' - new hypotheses, small data sets and 'negative' results all have their place in the chain of science discovery. Simply find the place for your ideas and contribute them: all your contributions are added to your personal page where peers can easily what sort of work you do and how well received it has been.

### Review
As a registered user, review the work of others. A replacement for traditional closed and pre-publication peer review, the Octopus system aims to value work for its scientific quality, not for its attractiveness to journal editors. Any registered reader can provide 1-5 ratings of contributions on pre-defined scales as well as leave a comment. With no anonymous log-ins, all review comments will be treated the same as other original contributions and be displayed on the reviewer's own personal page. This will reward constructive, collaborative reviewing.

## Octopus will incorporate existing tools:

Octopus may sound an overly ambitious project, but we are not planning to reinvent the wheel unnecessarily. There are many [recent innovations](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/) in scholarly communication. Which of these could help realise the Octopus vision? Are there others out there that we haven't considered? Let us know!

### Essential attributes:
* Application Programming Interfaces
* Domain and Publishing Standards
* Persistent Identifiers
* Sustainable and Affordable

## Work in progress:
### The chain of science. The principle behind Octopus is to break the 'unit of publication' down from being a 'paper' to its constituent parts. In Octopus each can be published individually, as long as it is linked to an existing published example from the level above:
